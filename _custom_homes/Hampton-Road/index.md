short-description: "This custom home was designed for clients that love entertaining their family. Casual living was also very important as home design makes no provision for formal living. Situated in a gated community on a very special riverfront lot with large mature like oaks, every effort was made to locate and preserve these trees. Additionally, a natural buffer between home and riverfront preserves the experience for kayakers on this popular waterway."

The clients wanted to capture a Southern Tidewater look for exterior as they felt it in keeping with the oaks and environment. Broad columned Veranda's, both front and back, serve to cool incoming breezes. A large open trussed rear Veranda features an expansive outdoor kitchen directly adjacent to kitchen as well as a large stone fireplace.

The centerpiece of the home is the grand Great Room/Dining Space with open Kitchen that literally runs the entire length of home. The soaring vaulted ceiling with exposed beams and rafters is lit with dormers. The space is completed by a massive brick fireplace. All the interior walls are clad in white washed tongue and groove paneling to finalize look.

Above the garage is a space that accommodates long term guests a sense of independence with its own living space including small kitchen.
