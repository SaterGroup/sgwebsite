short-description: "This waterfront plan requires open space with exposure to views and access to outdoor living areas, so I designed the house around the landscape, oriented toward the river with panels of glass to take in the scenery. The home captures a sense of the region in unique ways, with a complex elevation that adds depth and textural interest to the contemporary European styling. I wanted the core of the home - the central living area - to be entirely open, from the entry to the steps leading down to the pool, with outstanding views and a subtle sense of tradition."

On the banks of the Imperial River, in [Bonita Springs](http://www.cityofbonitasprings.org/ "The city of Bonita Springs Florida"), this modern Mediterranean villa boasts a subdued contemporary elevation and a deeply comfortable floor plan. The core of the home opens to a winding terrace and a sculpted pool and spa area that overlooks the river. Retreating glass doors create seamless boundaries that take in scenery and allow fresh air to circulate throughout the interior. To the left of the entry, a rotunda and dome ceiling illuminate the circular stairwell leading to the lofts and recreation areas. On the upper level, a media room and secluded office compliment the private master retreat on the main floor. To the right of the plan, guest quarters, a game room and deck share a loft, and an exercise room leads to a remote suite above the garage.
