short-description: "Rich in detail, the exterior of Benichini features spiral pilasters, carved eave brackets and clerestory windows. Every room in this home was oriented to take in as much of the wide, rear waterfront as possible. The result is a home that embraces the tranquil views that surround it. Despite the grand and luxurious aspects of the overall design, ceiling treatments, warm finishes and thoughtful details foster an intimate and inviting feeling throughout the home."
