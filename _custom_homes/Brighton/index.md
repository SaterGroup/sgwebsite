short-description: "This custom one-of-a-kind home was created for clients wanting a home that took the best advantage of lake and golf course views. They also wanted open casual areas for family and guests, but also dramatic formal areas for entertaining including a stand behind wet bar and concealed walk-in wine cellar. They wanted a modern home, but with a nod to European classicism. "

Creating good impressions begins from first approaching the home, to entering the nearly two-story Foyer and Grand Salon beyond. This leads to a glass wall and views of the pool and lake beyond. A large wet bar is central to entertaining, located strategically between the Grand Salon and Dining Room.

Passing through a vestibule leads to a large casual Great Room with informal dining and kitchen. The Nook features mitered glass bay windows. The Great Room has cornerless pocketing glass doors that open onto the wrap around outdoor living space with outdoor kitchen.

The three guest suites are located off of this area. Each features private bath and views of either the lake or courtyard.

Opposite the home is the Study and Master Retreat. The Master entered via a private foyer, features a morning kitchen, his/hers walk-in closets and is completed with a sumptuous Master Bath fit for royalty.

**It is easy to see why this home is so loved by it’s owners.**
