short-description: "This Southern estate home was designed for our clients to be reminiscent of northern Italian villas they came to love from their many visits there. Set on over 2 acres at the end of a cul-de-sac, the homes entrance is highlighted with a curved stone wall and fountain. The home stands waiting to greet visitors at the end of an Italian Cypress-lines gravel road. The home is elevated because of flood requirements."
