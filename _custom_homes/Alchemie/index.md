plan-name: "Alchemie"
highlighted-text: "a Modern Classic"
home-type: "Custom"
short-description: "The horizontal structure of this home achieves a careful balance with layered, asymmetrical gables and multifaceted rooms that add depth and texture to the elevation. My primary focus was on the relationship of the home to the landscape: the house is open to the south, facing the water, and the main living areas border a nearly continuous wall of glass. With roots in the Midwest, my clients wanted a clear link between the indigenous surroundings and the postmodern sensibility of the home, so I added regional brick accents and created an open silo-style form for the dining room."

Situated on a site that slopes toward a winding river, this prominent contemporary plan expresses a cultural association with its Midwestern setting through the use of regional materials, such as pale-brick panels and piers. Native fieldstone surrounds the lower walkout level and a wrapping lanai, without interfering with views of the woods and waterway. The long, semi-public southeastern face looks toward the river from all floors, addressing wide vistas with an open arrangement of rooms. Curved layers of glass illuminate the interior during daylight hours, and reflect delicately lit rooms at night. Structured to engage panoramas of scenery with highly functional rooms, the unique, tri-axial plan establishes intimate
links with the site.
