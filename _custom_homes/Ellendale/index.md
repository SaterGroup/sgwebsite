The main living level floor plan is all about relaxation and entertaining. The guest is greeted upon entering by a two story barreled ceiling Grand Salon, which in turn looks out onto a fountained courtyard. After passing the stairway and elevator is the Kitchen, Dining and Leisure Room. The Leisure Room features dual corner-less sliding glass walls that look out onto the fountained courtyard and a second courtyard featuring a pool. There is also a Solana which features a fireplace and outdoor kitchen. The main level also includes a three car garage.

Also on the main level floor plan is the Master Suite, which looks out onto the courtyard. It features a spacious Master Bath, his/her closets and a private staircase to the Study above.

The second level floor plan features a guest sitting loft, four Guest Suites each with private baths, a Study, Exercise Room and a Game Room. The Game Room has a wet bar with a wine cellar and two balconies, one that overlooks the pool area and has an adjacent powder bath just outside the entry doors. Each Guest Suite also has either a private balcony or access to a shared wrap around balcony deck that overlooks both courtyards.

This custom luxury home design exudes “Old World” Italian charm, but with all the benefits of modern amenities. Let us at The Sater Group create that special custom home plan for you. We will consider it an honor to do so.
