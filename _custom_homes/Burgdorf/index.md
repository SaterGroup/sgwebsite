short-description: "We work very hard to bring to life our client's vision. In this case the client had a beautiful location right on the water. What they wanted was a home that would make them feel as if they were on vacation. I blended modern design with traits from traditional northern Italian villas to give them something unique. The floor plan was specifically designed to take advantage of the great water views."
