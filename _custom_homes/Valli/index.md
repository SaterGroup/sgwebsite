home-type: "Luxury Custom"
short-description: "This is an adventurous work with many modern components as well as an amalgam of fundamental, organic components. The site wraps a bend in the waterway and, naturally, the clients wanted plenty of views, so I designed the forward core of the plan to overlook the southern lagoon and oriented the rear perimeter toward the river. The dramatic glass gable makes a statement about the contemporary nature of the home, yet the rooms are designed to flow easily from one space to another: it’s a very livable home."

Slightly below a bend in the [Imperial River](http://www.floridarambler.com/florida-canoeing-kayaking-paddling/imperial-river-kayak-trail-bonita-springs/ "the Imerial River, Florida"), the site also overlooks an islet of the Fishbowl bayou - named for its unusual shape - and, to the west, the Gulf of Mexico. Angled lines define the contemporary elevation, which wraps the waterway and offers panoramic views across the rear perimeter. The formal core of the home overlooks the koi pond, pool and spa, while an interior breezeway opens to a vaulted formal dining room with a “floating” beam ceiling and walls of glass that fill the space with natural light. Public rooms progress seamlessly into the private wings of the home, while a gallery segues into the master foyer, providing pocket-door access to the owners’ exercise room. Ceiling coves and coffers offer definition to airy rooms that flex to facilitate many functions. Throughout the home, a pleasing juxtaposition of modern aesthetics and traditional flow creates a natural environment and a sense of elegance.
