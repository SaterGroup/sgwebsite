short-description: 'In many ways, this is a revival home, with neoclassical lines and an interplay of contemporary elements, such as the stacked turrets and cantilevered bays. Primarily, the house conforms naturally to the site and responds to the region by incorporating light and views with a diversity of forms. My clients wanted a well-scaled, comfortable home, yet the abstract aspects of the design appealed to them as well. The house is literate in its approach to the past, with a bow to mid-century modern and international styles, but the overall sense of the home is one of spacious comfort and livability.'

A contemporary translation of ancient courtyard themes, this modern villa surrounds a veranda and koi pond that meander through the core of the design, connecting the rooms with an intimate sense of the outdoors. The internal circulation is enriched by a series of French doors and retreating glass walls that frame secluded views of the landscape. A pair of casitas frames the grand portico and colonnade that lead to a formal entry of serenely simple paneled-glass doors and sidelights. The dramatic roofline riding sober the forecourt establishes the avant-garde theme, which prevails throughout the public and private realms - even to the idiosyncratic d&eacute;cor of the traditional spaces. This home is a pleasing mixture of modern and classical architecture, where well-carved fascia and cornices enrich bays topped with transoms on cupolas.
