Situated on over two acres, the home has a rambling flow neatly separating the distinct areas of the home. This includes the master area, living area, entertainment area and mother-in-law suite. Creating private areas for the owners was a big part of the design. The master retreat features a sitting room, adjacent outdoor living area, his office and a private garden.

Energy efficiency and sustainability were major goals as well. The clients employed an energy efficiency expert that resulted in energy costs that are a fraction of other similarly sized homes. Natural lighting is employed in every single room of the home as well.

The cornerless sliding glass doors make the great room an extension of the outdoor living area for entertaining and enjoyment. Everything about this home revolved around enjoyment of the outdoors. Close collaboration between design principles ensured the landscaped environment complemented the home’s interior spaces and setting.
