short-description: "The clients had a very specific vision for this home that included large, comfortable spaces for their guests and family. I knew they wanted a tropical getaway and a sense of informality, and that the site - on a stretch of coastline along the Gulf of Mexico - would offer spectacular views. So I drew what basically became an extended L-shaped plan, keeping the landscape in mind. There is grandeur about this plan, yet the house easily takes in scenery, and the courtyard, loggia, terrace and decks expand the living areas into the outdoors."
