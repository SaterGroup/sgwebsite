short-description: "Our clients chose an authentic Tuscan architectural style for their home, so I wanted to bring in evocative elements - such as carved limestone, mahogany trim and Ludowici clay roof tiles - that would also fit the coastal site. The solid-rail balconies, massive stone gables, carved-wood corbels and recessed entry are programmatic essentials that provide a sense of history. I developed the fractured vertical scale at the streetscape to lend a sense of layering over time and to prevent the house from appearing too large."

Prior to breaking ground, the owners made clear their desire for an Old World villa-by-the-sea approach to a narrow, elongated waterfront site. Natural growth frames the edges of the stone pavers leading to the wrought-iron entry gates, which link to the front courtyard. A mosaic tile centerpiece anchors the front terrace, with planters and tall trees at each corner flanking sets of French doors that access separate guest wings and bring in natural light. The formal dining room enjoys a vista of the entry court as well as the Gulf through a wall of windows in the grand salon. French doors lead to the sun deck and down to the sea via the poolside steps.
