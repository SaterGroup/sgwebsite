This model home designed for a luxury golf and water oriented community was to introduce this custom builder’s quality excellence to the public. The biggest challenge was to convince the developer to loosen the ARB guidelines that required Mediterranean exterior styling. Fortunately the developer was very amenable to the proposal and the completed model home has been a great success.

Designed to maximize views of the expansive lake, almost every major room has waterfront views. We also introduced a Club Room and balcony upstairs as the views from there are fantastic. We also incorporated an additional Guest Suite upstairs.

Casual yet elegant informal living was the theme with its high ceilinged Great Room and Dining areas. The Master Suite has a sitting area, large walk-in closets, his and hers WC rooms and vanities and a stunning Master Bath.

Outdoor living is essential. This is accommodated by wrap around rear patio spaces, a grand Solana or outdoor leisure room, and an opulent outdoor kitchen.

The second garage can become a wonderful Man Cave for him with convenient access to the Master Bath for clean up from a day under the hood.

**This modern inspired home has it all.**
