Clad in Texas Limestone and capped with a slate roof, this home seems right at home in its surroundings. This was a second home design by us for our clients. Having loved their home we designed in SW Florida, they naturally wanted us to create the same features they loved in their new Texas home.

Designed to take advantage of its pie-shaped lot, almost every room has a view of the preserve beyond. A motor court entered via an arched breezeway accommodates the owner’s special car collection. There is a separate guest suite with a private entrance for long term visitors.

The dramatic formal living room with its curved glass wall overlooking the stunning pool and countryside beyond makes quite the first impression. The secluded master suite is a veritable private resort for its owners, with its octagonal sitting room, expansive closets and palatial bath with island jacuzzi and privacy garden.

Between the formal and informal areas is a staircase that leads to a guest sitting loft and guest rooms above. Under the staircase is a glass enclosed wine cellar. The gourmet kitchen is open to the nook and leisure room. Beyond it on the Veranda is an outdoor kitchen and pool bath. From here the view is breath-taking. The home also features a theater room for family enjoyment.
