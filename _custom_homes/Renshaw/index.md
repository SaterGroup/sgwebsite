Designed for a prominent national home builder as his familyâ€™s retreat, this home is all about casual relaxation and enjoyment for the family and their close friends. It is a retreat from the worries of life.

The home is elevated because of the flood restrictions of the site, with garage and storage below. This affords the main living level, which is on the second floor, stunning views. The center of the home is the beamed ceilinged Great Room with tray ceiling. The room offers views to the lagoon to the front and the river to the rear. Also on the main level floor plan is the kitchen, dining room, study as well as his/her master suites. An expansive outdoor veranda overlooks the pool with an infinity edge and incorporates an outdoor kitchen as well as a fireplace.

The upper level floor plan features a loft and three spacious guest suites, each with private ensuite baths.  The front guest suite even has a balcony overlooking the lagoon. Each level is accessed via a central stair tower that is wrapped around an elevator. The birdcage styled elevator features glass windows giving views to scenery beyond.

This custom designed house plan takes full advantage of its unusual site. The award winning design makes a distinct architectural statement for the enjoyment of its owners as well as boaters passing by. We always are rewarded with the satisfaction of completing successful projects for our clients.
