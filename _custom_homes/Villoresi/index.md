description: "The Villoresi, a South Florida estate home was designed for our clients to be reminiscent of northern Italian villas."
plan-name: "Villoresi"
highlighted-text: "a Luxury Estate"
home-type: "Vacation"
short-description: "Narrow lots are always a challenge. This client wanted to maximize the available land. It was important to use the space wisely. By situating the porte cochere on the side of the home it gives way to having the garage access in the back of the lot. The addition of a courtyard allows for the feeling of privacy and openness. Wrapping the house around a pool gives the home a vacation feel which the clients find very relaxing."
