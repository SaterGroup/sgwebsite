home-type: "Vacation"
short-description: "The client I designed this house for had very specific ideas and a unique perspective. The location was perfect for a custom home that drew from tradition Florida cottage home styles. Large porches, metal roofs, and lots of windows are staples of the old Florida style home. Because the home is located right on the water an island basement was used, beyond protection this style of basement allows for better usage of the lot space for storage."
