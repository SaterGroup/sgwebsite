short-description: "In this home - perhaps more than in many others - the living areas relate to one another in a particularly meaningful way. The dining room and parlor, for example, connect via a gallery that brings light to both spaces and creates an atmosphere that invites people to mingle. Enabling the client to entertain great groups of family and guests comfortably was a primary focus for me, as well as connecting indoor zones with outer living areas and great views."

Nested amid panoramas so wide they easily reveal the gentle curve of the earth, the European-style villa fits its pristine location seamlessly. The refined elevation faces a frontier of preserved wetlands and straddles the lush, subtropical fairways of a local golf club. A deeply recessed entry leads to an open arrangement of the foyer, parlor and formal dining room - a vaulted arena defined by massive stone columns - and takes in wide views of the pool and rear property. The stair hall creates an easy transition from the traditional spaces to a well-organized yet wide-open casual retreat, which includes a capacious leisure room designed for large informal gatherings. A media room opens to the outdoors and links closely to a portico and solana, warmed by a fireplace.

At the opposite end of the house, the owner’s retreat features a coffered ceiling, private sitting area and sumptuous master bath. On the second level, owners have the benefit of a secluded study, another sitting area an an observation deck. A spectacular tower loft cars the third story of the stair tower and offers panoramic views of the countryside.
