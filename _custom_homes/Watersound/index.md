The client wanted a modern home with a Mediterranean flavor, with stucco and stone accents to give it warmth. Every room needed to have a view towards the water. There was also a large Banyan tree with a tree house from the previous owners that the client wanted to save. In order to keep the home oriented towards the water, it was required to keep it away from the street. This created an opportunity to create an estate like approach to the home as it felt tucked away and secluded.

The homeâ€™s foyer with its barrel vaulted ceiling opens onto the spacious Great Room with high ceilings and view to pool and view beyond. The Great Room features a contemporary linear fireplace with stone surround. Directly adjacent to the Great Room is the island Kitchen and Dining Room beyond.

The Master Suite is tucked away and features his and hers closets and a sumptuous Master Bath with a garden tub that overlooks the Banyan Tree. The Master Suite features a radiused Sitting Ares with curved glass walls.

Near the Dining are His and Hers offices that offer panoramic views. The Gallery with its cloistered columns runs the length of the home. At one end is the stairwell and elevator leading to the Guest Suites and Loft for visiting guests. Each of these suites feature opulent bathrooms and breathtaking views of the water views beyond.

The two story Veranda off of the Great Room has a stone clad feature wall with TV and pocketing glass walls opening onto the pool and view.
