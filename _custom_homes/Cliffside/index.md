The sloped site had exposed rock formations which the clients desired to keep. Competing for the spectacular view beyond was an incredible swimming pool designed by good friend and noted landscape architect Scott Windham. The upper pool is lined with Bisazza glass tiles. The radiused infinity edge feeds a rock waterfall onto the lower pool, which includes a hidden grotto.

This house is designed to impress. Upon entry one is drawn to a floor to ceiling glass wall overlooking the pool, lake and golf course beyond. Just outside the glass is a two story water wall feature that feeds into the pool.

The home is naturally about celebrating family and has spacious rooms to accommodate doing just that. The leisure room features multiple sitting areas and is surrounded by glass. The large island kitchen overlooks the Leisure Room and view beyond.

The owners suite is tucked away to one end of the house, giving it a very private feel.
The upper level offers ensuite bedrooms for the kids as well as their very own loft area for homework, entertaining friends or just relaxing.

The lower level offers entertainment and sleeping space for guests. It features a game room, theater room, morning kitchen and much more.

This house plan was just what our clients needed and for us that is a reward, creating for our clients a perfectly suited home design.
