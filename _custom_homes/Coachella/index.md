short-description: "There’s a sense of grandeur about this retreat that goes beyond the European-style structure of the home. We started with an incredibly unique lot surrounded by water with an adjacent, smaller peninsula - where the guest casita is now located - and oriented the house toward the bay. There needed to be plenty of outside living space, so I drew the plan to follow the contours of the site and extended the veranda to encompass an outdoor dining area. The courtyard arcade offers a welcoming experience at the front of the home, and a variety of spaces unfold from the gallery."

Surrounded by water, the house takes advantage of panoramic views with a series of bays, French doors and windows. A seasonal pied-à-terre, the primarily Italian-style villa promotes a sense of privacy through a gated entry and a stunning porte-cochere. Anchored by a sculpted foundation and lush planters, the forecourt leads to the formal entry and foyer via a processional experience that enhances the European flavor of the façade. The traditional rooms at the front of the plan open to the rear veranda, an arrangement that satisfies the client’s desire to entertain. A gallery hall and stairwell link the casual living zone to a mid-level guest suite and a private loft retreat at the top of the tower, which grants breathtaking views of the region. On the opposite side, a rambling master suite takes in bay vistas and provides its own access to the veranda and pool.
