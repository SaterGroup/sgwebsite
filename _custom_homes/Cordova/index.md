home-type: "Custom"
short-description: "Inspired by our very own Cordillera home plan, this client wanted to expand it to house their multi-generational family, as well as reflect the styling of their Middle Eastern heritage. The Cordova home design definitely has a more Moroccan/Andalusian flavor to its exterior. With its castellated features, towers, turrets, corbels, terra cotta tiles and Turkish Limestone cladding and accents, it makes an impressive statement. Situated overlooking river frontage, the views are spectacular."
