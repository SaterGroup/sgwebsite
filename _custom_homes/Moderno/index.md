home-type: "Luxury"
short-description: "The Moderno home plan is a blend of clean contemporary styling and elegant casual living. Its presence gives a sense of space way beyond its 3507 square feet of living area. Open flowing spaces lend the Moderno to its uncanny ability to entertain large or small groups or create intimacy for its owners. Incorporating stuccoed walls with stacked stone accents give a modern yet warm appearance to the Moderno home plan. The home is crowned with a standing seam metal hipped roof. Cabled railing and bronze framed windows complete the ensemble."
