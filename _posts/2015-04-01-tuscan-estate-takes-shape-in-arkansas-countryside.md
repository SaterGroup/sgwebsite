A custom Sater Group designed Tuscan estate is slowly taking shape in the Arkansas countryside. This beautiful and stately Old World villa has been under construction for almost three years now. The slow but meticulous handiwork is self evident in the highly detailed finishes. The clients chose the Tuscan style as it reflected a warm, but rustic charm. Its placement atop a knoll which overlooks a 5 acre lake seems to complement and complete the home's appearance. Completion is estimated by the end of this year.

Interior design is by Jett Segal and landscape architecture is by [Windham Studios](http://windhamstudio.com "Windham Studios"). Both firms are frequent collaborators with Dan on many of his international creations.

The home consists of four levels including a walk-out basement. The fourth is a tower retreat for casual relaxation and viewing lake and **240** wooded acres beyond. It features an entry courtyard with overlooking two story colonnade and fountain. It is clad with native stone and cut Indiana limestone.
