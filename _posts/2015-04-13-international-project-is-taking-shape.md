A series of three Middle Eastern homes designed by **The Sater Group** are taking shape in the desert. This international project is one of many by **The Sater Group**. Each home is enclosed within its own distinct walled area. These homes are approximately **21,000** square feet of living area for the main house. The homes are designed in a Mediterranean inspired architectural style with tiled roofs, stuccoed walls and hand carved stone accents. The homes open onto a large glass roofed pool area with outdoor living areas overlooking manicured gardens.

Each estate has a complex that incorporates other support buildings including detached garage and entry gates. The homes walls are approximately **22"** thick to provide protection from the harsh local climate. It has been a great privilege to design these homes and many others in distant locales. This demonstrates for us that creating unique luxury homes is appreciated regardless of climate or culture.
