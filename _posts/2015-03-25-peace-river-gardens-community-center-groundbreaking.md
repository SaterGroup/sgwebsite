Groundbreaking on the new Peace River Garden's Community Center building was recently celebrated at the Bi-Annual meeting of the Tetrault Family Foundation of which Dan Sater is a member last week. Mr. Sater designed the new building as well as the original family estate home. This is part of the first phase in the opening of this beautiful new sculpture and botanical gardens. This building will house a cafe, administration offices, restrooms and meeting space. When completed the [Peace River Gardens](http://www.peacerivergardens.org/) will encompass over **27 acres** and be one of the most preeminent gardens of its kind in Florida. Grand opening is scheduled for the **2016** season.

#### What are the Peace River Gardens?

The Peace River Garden's mission is to provide a natural setting along the Peace River showcasing world-class sculptures and spectacular botanicals to inspire creativity throughout the community. Their vision and guiding principals are to share ideals of gardening in a sub-tropical region, to educate our community on local flora and preservation, to share our location with local wildlife, and to inspire an artistic spirit in others by curating sculptures and fine art from around the world. They plan to accomplish this with the use of 27 acres of preserved native habitats that will provide a home to many aquatic and terrestrial species, best seen from the expansive boardwalks. Flowering trees and plants will bloom year round amidst sculptures from across the globe.
