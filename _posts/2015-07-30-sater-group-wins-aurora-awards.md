The Aurora Awards we represented at the [Southeast Builders Conference](http://sebcshow.com/) (**SEBC**) Black Tie Gala event at the Rosen Center in Orlando, FL on July 18. The Award competition recognizes achievements in building design.

The Aurora Awards is a competitive award competition held during [Southeast Builders Conference](http://sebcshow.com/) (**SEBC**). [Florida Home Builders Association](http://www.fhba.com/) (**FHBA**) sponsors the Award competition; one of the largest associations of it's kind. The Aurora Award design competition is presented to outstanding builders, planners, architects, developers, designers, and interior merchandisers within a twelve state southeastern and eastern Caribbean region.

The design competition since it's inception thirty-five years ago, continues to grow and honor residential and commercial designers and builders in 135 categories. Categories consist of Commercial, Residential, Price Point, Energy Efficiency, Green Building, Merchandising, Interior Design and many more. The winners in the categories also recognize major team members that contributed on the project.

An Aurora Award can be awarded to one entrant in each of the 135 categories. In addition to the 135 categories there are Grand Aurora Awards based on sub categories and one (this year there was a tie) Golden Aurora Award for the whole Award competition. For a complete list of all Award winners please visit [The Auroras website](http://www.TheAuroras.com)</a>
