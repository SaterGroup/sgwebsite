        "content": "So we have selected our home site, the perfect team, established realistic expectations and from that created our wish list. Now we are ready to start the preliminary design process. The preliminary design process is critical to the success of the home’s design and function so it should not be rushed. You and your design professional need to work closely so that they understand your expectations completely.Also make sure your design professional has researched and understands all zoning requirements. Including code restrictions as well as any community guidelines that may limit or restrict the design.I have found that for myself and my clients it is best to begin sketching the initial floor plan together. This way I can get instant feedback about relationships of rooms to one another. When creating the prelims one has to think of the entirety of the design including the exterior appearance. Usually at the end of a two to three hour session we walk away with a rough concept of the desired floor plan and sometimes even the elevation.I then take the sketch and refine it for presentation to client. This is a time when I encourage the client to spend time studying and reviewing the floor plan. More or less getting acquainted with it as this home will be a constant companion for many years so it needs to be well suited to your needs.Another important consideration for the design is how well it fits the site. Does it take advantage of views, avoid undesirable views (i.e.: neighboring homes, power poles, etc.) and address the street properly. We always show the preliminary floor plan on the actual site plan to get an understanding of its relationship to it. Evaluating proper room size is a critical task. Either working with your designer or an interior designer to look at furniture placement in each room to ensure the room functions as desired. Will that dining room accommodate a table for 10 people? Can two full sized beds fit on that wall? Etc…Refining the Preliminary DesignOnce we’ve arrived at a satisfactory floor plan, we can now work to refine the exterior elevation. Creating the front elevation is the icing on the cake. Most clients have difficulty reading a two dimensional rendering. Trust in your designer is important. Your design professional may employ three dimensional modeling which can be very beneficial in understanding the actual home better. I am still a dinosaur and create designs on paper. However we have offered clients the ability to have an outside source create a perspective rendering to help them reach a comfort level with the actual design. Nothing can be worse than to find that you are less than thrilled with your new home’s exterior.Once you’ve finalized the preliminary design process you can talk with your builder to get rough estimates of building costs before moving into working drawings. You may need to get preliminary approval from your Architectural Review Board (ARB) if you live in a planned community.Proper planning can ensure a successful and rewarding home building experience for all.This is the fifth blog in a nine part series entitled “Custom Home Design’s Rewards and Challenges”.

        "author": "Dan Sater",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Building a custom home is a daunting task, but it can be very rewarding with proper planning, preparation, wise choices and realistic expectations. This article will deal with planning and preparation and it starts with a wishlist.Thoughtful itemization of each space and desired features is critical in effectively communicating to your design professional(s). It’s also important to have a discussion with them about the way you live and use your home. For example, do you like to entertain, cook, play games, read, etc.? Creating a home that fits your lifestyle is more important than the right collection of rooms.As mentioned in our previous article, it is important to set realistic goals. One must consider your wishlist as it compares to your budget. I once had a client that wanted a list of spaces that would have been over 12,000 square feet and over $3 million to build. However their square footage requirement was 9,000 square feet and had a budget of $1.5 million. I responded by asking which house did they want to build? The 12,000, the 9,000 or the 5,000 square foot one they budgeted for?I was once asked by a publisher to write a book titled “The Smaller Home”. I responded by saying “are you sure you have the right designer?” Our firm is mostly known for our luxury home designs. In that book I dealt with this issue in detail, even creating a wishlist template. It is important to prioritize each item, as your wishlist, budget and final cost to build often conflict. While that theater room may be nice, how important is that feature? Another part of the equation is honestly evaluating how often you would use that feature. We have done many home theaters, for example, and have found after the newness wears off, these room are seldomly used.The Wishlist can be Time SensitiveAnother factor to consider is the longevity of use for a particular room or feature. We have created bedrooms for an infant near the Master Bedroom. By the time planning, permitting and construction are completed the child’s use of that space is no longer needed. They have matured in the process and no longer need to be right next to the parents.When you list rooms and sizes, think more in terms of how many people you want to seat or accommodate This is more effective than deciding on a certain room size that may or may not accomplish the desired need.Another proactive step is to list things you do not like in a home. I once had a client that gave me more stated dislikes than likes. This further helps your design professional in crafting your home design.In conclusion, the more thought and detail invested into creating your wish list, the better your initial preliminary design results will be.This is the fourth blog in a nine part series entitled “Custom Home Design’s Rewards and Challenges”.

        "author": "Dan Sater",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Creating Realistic Expectations for your new home building project can save you a lot of time, energy and heartache. This is one of the most problematic issues I have encountered in my 35 years of home design. There are three major areas where most clients make false assumptions that can hamper a successful design process.Friends and Family ConnectionIf only I had a dollar for every time I heard the phrase “ Yes, but we have an Uncle that does ___”. While many of us may know someone related to construction, it is unrealistic to assume this connection will yield double digit percentage savings. In fact unless you are building as an owner/builder utilizing a special connection may even be frowned upon your builder as it may cause more trouble than it’s worth to him. Being an owner/builder also yields many difficulties that I will detail more in the next section.Using a friend or family member may cost you more than any imagined savings as their handling of a job as a favor can mean time delays and costs for you.Are you really Smarter than an 8th GraderWe all naturally imagine we are smarter than the next person. I wish this was actually true. If every contractor and design professional you meet with tells you typical costs per square foot are $200, why would you still talk about a $150 per square foot budget as attainable? Failing to come to terms with prevalent costs and your actual budget can be extremely painful. I have worked with many clients that failed to do this. They ended up six months down the road with house plans that are useless to them and countless hours expended by their contractor and his/her sub-contractors for a pointless exercise. Please don’t make this mistake.Eyes are too big for the StomachSimilar to the other mistakes, setting a realistic program and budget are essential to a successful home design effort. I once had clients that had put together an extensive list of rooms and features they wanted for their new home. Their list included six bedrooms, game room, theater room and much more. Their list from my experience dictated a home of over ten thousand square feet yet their desired square footage was less than eight thousand. Better sill, their budget wouldn’t build a six thousand square foot home. I asked them “ Which home do you want to build?”.When putting together your wish list, critically analyze how essential each space is and how it fits within your budget. Always keep in mind that consumers typically see their home costs go another ten percent above their original contract amount. Will you really use that dedicated theater room or will it simply become a rarely used extravagance? Do I really need a Great Room to seat ten people when that need may only occur a few times a year?In ConclusionSetting realistic and achieve able goals in building your next dream home can save you from unnecessary frustration and cost. Not to mention countless hours and months of time chasing a rabbit that isn’t real. Designing and building a new custom home can be a rewarding and even fun experience if you do.This is the third article in a nine part series entitled “Custom home design’s rewards and challenges”.

        "content": "Selecting the Right Team for Home DesignJust as important as selecting the right site is selecting the Ideal Home Design Team. Securing the proper building designer, building contractor, interior designer and landscape architect/designer are critical to ensuring a well built custom luxury home. Each principal plays a vital role in the design process.Home Design ProfessionalIn selecting the ideal home design team, the building designer is critical in helping you assess the site and your needs to see if the two are compatible. They can take your wishlist and ideas and craft them into a home that takes full advantage of your site and its challenges. In interviewing candidates make sure you feel a chemistry with them and that they are attuned and concerned with your needs. Check their references to see how past clients felt about their experience. Selecting a designer that is either a licensed architect or a certified professional building designer can give you confidence as to their knowledge and/or ability. They can usually assist you in selecting some of the other team members as well. Remember price alone should not be a sole determinant in selecting this person. They can add value far beyond their fees if they are accomplished design professionals.Home BuilderThe building contractor is another critical part of the team. Their knowledge and experience can be indispensable to ensuring a well built home and a smooth build process. In addition to the same interview questions in selecting a building designer, make sure their background is compatible with the type and style of home you are building. For example a builder that builds mostly tract homes may not be a candidate for your new luxury custom home. Make sure they are team players and enjoy working with other team members. They should desire to create for you the best possible home and not simply the most convenient process for them.Interior DesignerThe interior designer is another important team member. There should definitely be a good chemistry between yourself and this professional. You will have to work extremely close with this professional as you evaluate and design the home’s character and fit to your lifestyle and tastes. They are important in evaluating the home’s schematic design and whether it will accommodate your furniture and needs. For this reason they should be brought on at least before you finalize your preliminary floor plan. It is much easier to adjust a wall length or window placement in this stage of the design process.Landscape Architect/DesignerThe landscape architect or designer is another important part of the team. They provide so much more than simply plant selections. We utilize landscape architects to design driveways, pools/spas, patios, outdoor fireplaces, trellises and so much more. I always think of their contribution as the gown for the bride.Other Team MembersOther team players to consider are lighting designers, A/V designers, structural and mechanical engineers. Proper allowance and consideration for each of these disciplines can make the final product even better.Remember, selecting the ideal home design team can make the difference between satisfaction and heartbreak in the biggest undertaking of most of our lives…building a new custom home.",

        "content": "This is the first blog in a series relating to the challenges and opportunities in building a new custom home.Many consumers are leery of designing and building a custom home and for many good reasons. As a professional building designer for over 35 years I have seen firsthand the benefits as well as the pitfalls experienced in the process. It doesn’t matter whether you have built a home before or where it is being built. These problems are almost universal. I will be posting a series of blogs to highlight the ups and downs as well as how to make the home design endeavor an enjoyable one.Find The Perfect Site!The home’s site is the first and most critical decision in the home building process. Frank Lloyd Wright said about selecting a site “Go to the very edge of town and then drive another seven miles further”. A great number of factors need to be considered. If you work, your commute time is a big factor. Do you want acreage or amenities? Does privacy outweigh being in a deed restricted community?Once you have settled on a particular site you will need to do a lot of research. If it is unimproved land, are there utilities nearby? What is the zoning restrictions (if any) to building on the property? Will you need a well, septic system? Please remember, large unimproved sites will have much greater infrastructure costs associated with them.Can’t Build on The Perfect Site?If you choose a lot in a deed restricted community, make sure you understand those restrictions before purchasing. Don’t be surprised when you can’t build that contemporary home because the community guidelines call for an exclusively Colonial style. Are there minimum square footage requirements that may force you to build a larger home than you want?I work with many clients that become frustrated dealing with the restrictions of their community and their ARB or “Architectural Review Board”. However remember this process is intended to protect both yourself and your neighbor’s investment. If individual expression is your passion, you had better think twice about a deed restricted community.&lt;Other considerations are governmental restrictions. Building setbacks; minimum floor elevation; height, use and coverage restrictions should be carefully examined by you and your design professional or builder.If you consider carefully your home site and its limitations upfront you are well on your way to an enjoyable building experience.Next Issue: Selecting The Perfect Team",

This beautiful and stately Old World villa has been under construction for almost three years now. The slow but meticulous handiwork is self evident in the highly detailed finishes. The clients chose the Tuscan style as it reflected a warm, but rustic charm. Its placement atop a knoll which overlooks a 5 acre lake seems to complement and complete the home’s appearance. Completion is estimated by the end of this year.Interior design is by Jett Segal and landscape architecture is by Windham Studios. Both firms are frequent collaborators with Dan on many of his international creations.The home consists of four levels including a walk-out basement. The fourth is a tower retreat for casual relaxation and viewing lake and 240 wooded acres beyond. It features an entry courtyard with overlooking two story colonnade and fountain. It is clad with native stone and cut Indiana limestone. Please contact us for more information on this beautiful custom luxury home design.

This building will house a cafe, administration offices, restrooms and meeting space. When completed the Peace River Gardens will encompass over 27 acres and be one of the most preeminent gardens of its kind in Florida. Grand opening is scheduled for the 2016 season.What are the Peace River Gardens?The Peace River Garden’s mission is to provide a natural setting along the Peace River showcasing world-class sculptures and spectacular botanicals to inspire creativity throughout the community. Their vision and guiding principals are to share ideals of gardening in a sub-tropical region, to educate our community on local flora and preservation, to share our location with local wildlife, and to inspire an artistic spirit in others by curating sculptures and fine art from around the world. They plan to accomplish this with the use of 27 acres of preserved native habitats that will provide a home to many aquatic and terrestrial species, best seen from the expansive boardwalks. Flowering trees and plants will bloom year round amidst sculptures from across the globe.",
